# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a 3D Calgary City Dashboard with LLM Querying capabilities, being developed as part of a MASIV Internship Assessment. The project appears to be in early planning/setup phase.

## Current State

- Repository is in initial setup phase
- No package.json or development infrastructure configured yet
- No source code structure established
- Only contains basic README.md documentation

## Next Steps for Development

When setting up this project, consider:

1. **Technology Stack Selection**: Determine the frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and 3D visualization library (Three.js, Babylon.js, etc.)
2. **Project Structure**: Establish src/, public/, and configuration directories
3. **Development Environment**: Set up package.json with build, dev, test, and lint scripts
4. **3D Visualization**: Plan the Calgary city data integration and 3D rendering approach
5. **LLM Integration**: Design the querying interface and backend API structure

## Important Notes

- This is a dashboard project requiring 3D visualization capabilities
- LLM querying functionality will be a core feature
- Project is specifically focused on Calgary city data
- Being developed for MASIV internship assessment
